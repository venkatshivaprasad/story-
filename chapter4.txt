branching : this helps in creating new branches where expermentation can be done without effecting the master or main branch 

when we this branch result we can then merge into the main branch .

// This branch is be done as fallows

1. To check the number of branches 

git branch 

// this gives list of  branches present . 


2. To add the new branch 

git branch name(anyname)

// again if we want check we use  git branch to all the branches 

3.when want to switch branches 

git checkout brachname 


// after modifying or adding anything in the new branch if u want to add it to the main branch or master branch 

Then we need to merge it to main branch 

4.firstly we need to come to the master branch 
  

5. Now to merge the branch 

git merge branchname(the name of branch u want to merge into master branch ). 


// then when we git log we can see all the commits made in new branch are also add to master branch
