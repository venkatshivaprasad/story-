 i hello doctor , how are you i hope u are fine


firstly we need to come to folder(using mkdir foldername) wher we need to perform git version control. 


1) create the files using (touch filename eg: touch chapter1.txt)

2) we have to intialise the git using (git init).

3) to check the hiding files inside the file(chapte1.txt) we use (ls -a ).

4) to find status of the file which which are add  
or  not we use(git status)

5) we add these file (chapter1.txt) using 

(git add chapter1.txt) if  there are more files to 

add all the files at once we use these (git add .)

6) after the file added  to git local repository we need to commit the changes which means we need to save it .  
 
To do these using these cammond (git commit -m "any string in present tense"

7 ) after commiting the changes to have look over changes made we use (git log)
